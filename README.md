# Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment

This project analyzes the relationship between trader behavior and market sentiment using real trading data and sentiment analysis. The analysis is performed using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and visualized with various plots.

## Folder Structure

- **csv files/**: Contains the raw and merged CSV data files used for analysis.
  - `merged_data.csv`: Main dataset combining trading and sentiment data.
  - `trader_summary (1).csv`: Summary statistics for traders.
- **notebook_1/**: Contains the main Jupyter Notebook for the analysis.
  - `Assignment_.ipynb`: Main notebook with code, analysis, and visualizations.
- **outputs/**: Contains generated plots and figures from the analysis.
  - `Average Daily Trading Volume by Sentiment.png`
  - `count of Fear vs Greed vs Neutral Days.png`
  - `PnL Over Time by Sentiment.png`
  - `profit vs volume.png`
  - `Profitability Distribution by Sentiment.png`
- **report/**: Contains the final data science report.
  - `Data science report.pdf`: PDF report summarizing the findings.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Assignment_.ipynb`) in the `notebook_1` folder.
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
3. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis and generate the plots.
4. Review the outputs in the `outputs` folder and the final report in the `report` folder.
